// This behavior triggers when Cozmo wants to purposely visit an interesting edge (and then flag as not-interesting
// anymore). It shows the player that Cozmo can see objects than don't have markers.

  // smallest quad is 6.25 half side. For 45 degree border on a leaf quad, there's a chance that
  // we would be colliding with our own quad within a few pixels. Mathematically we can see that it's x/2,
  // where x is the diagonal of the square of side 6.25.
  // pix = x/2 = sqrt(6.25*6.25+6.25*6.25)/2 = 4.42 mm approx
  // Instead of letting code handle this, I trusted data to configure a min distance that would prevent that issue.
  // The closest we can get then is min = ROBOT_FRONT + distanceInsideGoalToLookAt_mm + 4.42
  // = 32.1f + (15 atm) + 4.42 = 51.52 mm. Anything beyond that is separation betwen Cozmo and the goal.

  // Update: now the look at point is the position where we start to look for accurate edges. The grounplane
