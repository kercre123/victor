Further, You agree to treat the Header File Information with the same degree of care as You accord to Your own confidential information, but in any event no less than reasonable care.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
Sensory licenses the SDK to You on an "AS IS" basis and without warranty of any kind. SENSORY AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT AND CANNOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS YOU MAY OBTAIN BY USING THE SDK. EXCEPT FOR ANY WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION OR TERM TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SAME CANNOT OR MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY LAW APPLICABLE TO YOU IN YOUR JURISDICTION, SENSORY AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR TERMS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE OR OTHERWISE AS TO THE SDK OR ANY COMPONENT THEREOF, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, INTEGRATION, MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Some states or provinces do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties so the above limitations may not apply to You. You may have rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For further warranty information, You may contact the Sensory at the address provided above.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
IN NO EVENT WILL SENSORY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS WHATSOEVER ARISING FROM THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT AND/OR YOUR USE OF THE SDK OR ANY COMPONENT THEREOF, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF AN SENSORY REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION. SENSORY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00). Nothing contained in this License Agreement limits Sensory's liability to You in the event of death or personal injury resulting from Sensory's negligence or for the tort of deceit (fraud). Sensory is acting on behalf of its suppliers for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and/or limiting obligations, warranties and liability as provided in this License Agreement, but in no other respects and for no other purpose.

9. INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Sensory and its suppliers harmless from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorneys' reasonable fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of Developer Programs, provided that Sensory gives You prompt written notice of any such claim, tenders to You the defense or settlement of such a claim at Your expense, and cooperates with You, at Your expense, in defending or settling such claim.

10. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
You agree that any Developer Program that includes Sample Code and/or Redistributable Code (i) will include in its license agreement a reference to applicable U.S. Government regulations which control licensing of software and (ii) will not be shipped, transferred, or exported into any country or used in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, restrictions or regulations (collectively the "Export Laws"). In addition, if any part of the SDK is identified as export controlled items under the Export Laws, you represent and warrant that you are not a citizen, or otherwise located within, an embargoed nation (including without limitation Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Cuba, North Korea and Serbia) and that you are not otherwise prohibited under the Export Laws from receiving the SDK. All rights to use the SDK are granted on condition that such rights are forfeited if you fail to comply with the terms of this License Agreement.

11. GOVERNING LAW. This License Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws in force in the State of California. The courts of Santa Clara County, California shall each have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes relating to this License Agreement. This License Agreement will not be governed by the conflict of law rules of any jurisdiction or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.

12. GENERAL
You may not assign Your rights or obligations granted under this License Agreement without the prior written consent of Sensory. None of the provisions of this License Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of Sensory, its agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized signatory of Sensory. It is expressly agreed that a breach of Section 3 or 4 of this License Agreement will cause irreparable harm to Sensory and that a remedy at law will be inadequate. Therefore, in addition to any and all remedies available at law, Sensory will be entitled to seek an injunction or other equitable remedies in all legal proceedings in the event of any threatened or actual violation thereof. When conflicting language exists between this License Agreement and any other agreement included in this SDK (except for the Integration Key License Agreement or any agreement supplied with Sensory Software), this License Agreement shall supersede. If either Sensory or Developer employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this License Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees. You acknowledge that You have read this License Agreement, understand it, and that it is the complete and exclusive statement of Your agreement with Sensory which supersedes any prior agreement, oral or written, between Sensory and You with respect to the licensing to You of this SDK. No variation of the terms of this License Agreement will be enforceable against Sensory unless Sensory gives its express consent in a writing signed by an authorized signatory of Sensory.
