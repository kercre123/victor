- Added a sample for Android with AndroidStudio 3+
- Added get_camera_info to the C sample
- Added support for the x1 module

#### Bugfixes

- Added support for Zwetschge files
    - These will replace Lena files
    - In v3.21, Zwetschge will also be usable as flash images for the M2453
    - They allow the use cases to be stored in the file instead of the ModuleConfig
- Added a python tool to create Zwetschge files
    - This tool can create also create Lena files, as part of the migration path
    - For both .zwetschge and .lena, comments in the input files aren't included in the output
      files. However, it should no longer be necessary to hand-edit the .lena files, instead the
      input files can be edited, complete with all of their comments.
- Updated the .lena file for Salome to allow framerate changes
- Mirrored the harddrive folder structure in the Visual Studio folders for the imager component
- Separated support for M2453's A11 and B11 steppings
    - Added support for changing frame rates on the M2453 B11

#### Changes affecting source code customers

- Redesign of the eye safety pause when switching use cases
    - Now handled by the imager component instead of CameraCore; the pause is done in startCapture
      (which is also used internally when switching use cases)
    - For M2453, the "tail time" in Zwetschge was replaced with a "wait time", which is now actually adhered to
    - The other imagers use the same algorithm as before (it is now implemented in
      Imager.cpp and ImagerUseCaseDefinition.cpp)
- The minimum version of Python is now 3.5
- When cross-compiling, the host's Python interpreter will be used, not the target's
- New unit test and integration test utilities will use the royale::test::utils namespace
- Added shared test utils in LenaTestUtils.hpp, StorageTestUtils.hpp and ZwetschgeTestUtils.hpp
- The IImagerExternalConfig has moved to Royale's config component
- UuidlikeIdentifier's algorithm for hashing arbitrary strings is documented
    - The algorithm is unchanged, but it's no longer "implementation defined", and it will not
      change in future versions
    - Added a Python uuidlike_identifier.py that calculates the same hashes
- General refactoring to integrate Zwetschge

#### Bugfixes

- Cleanup of CppCheck warnings
- The UUID strings in Lena files and ModuleConfigs are parsed as UUIDs again
    - In v3.19.0, they changed to using UuidlikeIdentifier's hashing instead of parsing constructor
    - They all calculated the same IDs, so this only caused problems when comparing them to UUIDs
      read from the binary .zwetschge files
- Fixed CMake 3.11's warnings about CMP0072 (libGL vs libOpenGL)
- CMake changes to ensure that the SWIG (Python) files are regenerated when needed

- Fixed PLY files having values near the max for unsigned integers for invalid pixels

### Features for source code customers

- Added build instructions for the Python wrapper
- Added Salome Rev 2 modules
    - These use a separate config and Lena than the Salome Rev 1
- Use cases can now be linked to processing parameters by ProcessingParameterId
- Added UseCaseDefFactoryProcessingOnly, for reading Royale's data for Flash Defined Imagers
    - During bring-up, Flash Defined Imagers are likely to be configured with the existing
      ModuleConfig structures. This factory can be used as a filter, to ensure that only
      data that can be stored in the flash after bring-up is being used during bring-up.

#### Changes affecting source code customers

- Refactored internal implementation of auto exposure
- Adapted noise thresholds for pico monstar with glass lens
- The Windows CyAPI library is now used from the Cypress SDK
    - Using Enclustra and Amundsen USB devices will need the SDK to be installed on the machine
      building Royale. The requirements for running an already-built Royale are unchanged.

  (as the pico monstar and maxx only support the slave functionality)

#### Features

- Added first version of the Python wrapper for Royale
- Enabled external triggers (master/slave) for the pico maxx
- Capturing will be stopped if the internal current monitor of the
  IRD2381 triggers

#### Bugfixes

  for the use case
- Fixed a crash in the Matlab wrapper that could happen if mexprintf
  was called from different threads
- Fixed a crash when using SparsePointCloud data  
- Fixed a problem with switching use cases with Amundsen and UVC devices
  (e.g. pico monstar and pico maxx) on OSX

#### Known Bugs

### Features for source code customers

- Added an option to the SPIFlashTool to only write the header without
  calibration data
- Added the possibility to check the state of the internal current monitor
  of the IRS2381
- Added the possibility of linking to processing parameter maps by GUID

  Level 2 access

#### Bugfixes

v3.17.0 - 2018-05-04
--------------------

### SDK

#### Changes

- The coding style for the samples has been updated
    - C++ samples qualify "royale::" class names, instead of using the namespace
    - C# samples qualify "RoyaleDotNet." class names, instead of using the namespace

#### Features

- Enabled external triggers (master/slave) for the pico monstar

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed retrieval of calibration data from recordings
- Fixed retrieval of processing parameters from recordings
- On Linux, UVC based 3D cameras that are not currently in use by Royale can be seen by the V4L
  utilities.  They disappear from V4L's list when Royale opens the camera, the bugfix is that they
  now reappear when Royale closes the camera (the kernel UVC driver is reattached).
- Alea devices could not be set to the maximum exposure time

### Features for source code customers

- Pseudodata-based readings of NTC sensors can now be filtered with a weighted average

- Clarification of licensing
   - Open-source source can be downloaded from https://oss.pmdtec.com/

#### Features

- Updated the Royale license to explicitly allow usage embedded in an application
- Python samples now call CoInitialize on Windows, this fixes them not being able to find UVC
  cameras on Windows.
- Updated the processing library to Spectre 3.11
   - Parameter AUTO_EXPOSURE_SET_VALUE replaces EXPOSURE_REFERENCE_AMPLITUDE
- Add new error status returns if a specific device is only usable in L3 mode

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed lens center being ignored when camera is opened in raw mode
- The .NET SampleDotNetCameraInfo now defaults to building for x64 on 64-bit Windows

### Features for source code customers

- Rewrote README_tools.md for easy comparison of the existing flash tools
- Added IModuleConfigFactory.enumerateConfigs(), which can return a list of the configs that
  hardware probing could return, without needing hardware to probe
   - For devices that use unique identifiers for use cases (Salome and FacePlus), the
     without-hardware integration tests now check the identifiers for uniqueness
- Added JRoyale proof of concept for a wrapper-based Java interface on Android
- Added a beam profile use case for Salome

#### Changes affecting source code customers

- The imager class hierarchy is being restructured, with more separation between imagers that have
  factory-set timings (M2453, used in Salome and FacePlus), and imagers that calculate the timings
  in Royale
- Combined the Imager*DirectAccess classes in to a template
- For imagers using GUID-like strings in their Module Configs (Salome and FacePlus), handling of
  these identifiers is now encapsulated in the UseCaseIdentifier class.  The identifiers are now
  converted to an internal representation during construction
- Split UseCaseDefinition.getName() in to getTypeName() and getIdentifier()
   - Added documentation comparing UseCase.getName() to UCD.getTypeName()
- Callers of the UseCaseDefinition class' copy constructor and assignment operator are being
  refactored to avoid using these slicing operations, with the aim of moving to an
  IUseCaseDefinition interface
- Renamed RegisterMap to TimedRegisterList
- It's now possible to build a playback-only build of Royale, which can only use .rrf files

### USB firmware

#### Features

#### Bugfixes

#### Known Bugs

### Royale Viewer

#### Features

- Changed to a smaller font size on some combinations of display resolution and pixel density
- Added a checkbox to enable/disable the min/max filter
- When fast-forwarding and rewinding during playback of recordings with very few images, changed the
  minimum skip to 3 frames (for larger files it's 10% of the number of frames in the recording).

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed rewinding to the beginning (previously the rewind button would only go to frame 2)

v3.15.0 - 2018-03-23
--------------------

### SDK

#### Changes

- Alea and Salome devices are now officially supported
- For applications that use IDepthImageListener, the meaning of the confidence value has changed
    - If you don't see a compiler error, your application is almost certainly not affected
    - If your application is affected, it will receive a compiler error that "DepthImage::data" no
      longer exists, it has been renamed to "DepthImage::cdData"
    - Similar renames have been applied to the C and C# APIs
    - Documentation about the change is in the DepthImage.hpp file and DepthImage documentation
- Improved the startup time for M2453 devices with storage attached via the M2453
- Clarification of licensing
    - Added a contact address <info@pmdtec.com> for questions about licensing
    - Added a missing license for PackedArray

#### Bugfixes

- For C and C++ developers on Windows: replaced some _WINDOWS ifdefs with _WIN32, as _WIN32 is the
  official define, and some compilers do not define _WINDOWS
    - This was causing the samples to not see UVC devices.  For an explanation of why it affected
      UVC devices, please refer to samples/inc/sample_utils/PlatformResources.hpp
- Fixes for the C and C# APIs when using level 2 access
    - Fixed data corruption in intermediate data

- Use the ImagerType enum instead of uint32_t
- IImagerExternalConfig for M2453 imagers is changing to support new features
    - This will continue in v3.16.0, the new features are in the Zwetschge files

#### Changes affecting source code customers

- Directories have been rearranged to clarify ownership of parts of the codebase
    - This matches the copyright policy in the SLA
- Support for the M2452's A11 stepping has been removed
    - This is because all Royale-supported M2452 devices are using the B1x steppings
    - This is preparation for refactoring the M2452 imager code
- Animator boards running the USB firmware for C2 modules will now be treated as Animator boards
    - The C2 module itself was an M2452 A11 based device
    - The module config for a C2 + Animator board has now been renamed AnimatorDefault
    - The AnimatorDefault config has changed to match an Alea module by default
- The Lewis device has been renamed to FacePlus
    - Some of the Lewis use cases have changed to 60MHz
- Support for more devices in the flash and eraseFlash tools
- LibUVC has been removed, it has been disabled by default at build time since Royale v3.13.0
    - UVC devices are still supported, BridgeAmundsen supports both Amundsen and UVC firmware
- CMake will now report that the minimum CMake version is 3.0 for the imager's CMakeLists.txt
    - This has been required since v3.12.0, which used the string concat command

- Added Spectre 3.10

##### Features for source code customers

- Added a tool to update the maxx/monstar CX3 firmware
- The Doxygen for internal classes now includes royalecore
- Added SensorRoutingFilename which can be used to specify calibration
  files on the filesystem in the ModuleConfig to help bringing up new modules

##### Changes affecting source code customers

- Fixed a lot of CppCheck warnings
- Renamed FlashMemoryPolar to StorageFormatPolar
- Renamed FlashMemoryPico to StorageFormatPicoLegacy

#### Bugfixes

v3.13.0 - 2018-02-13
--------------------

### SDK

#### Changes

- Removed empty sections from this changelog

#### Features

- Enabled 64-bit file sizes on 32-bit systems, to support long .rrf recordings
- When recording .rrf files, the write buffer is now flushed after each frame. On Win32, the buffer
  was growing until the PC started freezing.
- Updated Spectre to v3.9
- Performance optimisations for BridgeAmundsen on all platforms
- For OSX and desktop Linux, changed the UVC support to use BridgeAmundsen instead of LibUVC
- The OpenCV sample now uses a Z-image specific scaling algorithm, instead of just normalizing it

##### Features for source code customers

- For devices where the imager reads an NTC temperature sensor, it's now possible to configure which
  reading is used from the set of raw frames that are combined in to a depth frame
- Added a new method to construct use cases, for details please refer to the unit test
  (TestUseCaseArbitraryPhases)
- CalibrationToolV7 can now write product identifiers to the flash
- Refactored the way in which ProcessingFlags are specified in ModuleConfigs, to reduce duplication
    - Each camera can have a common set of standard parameters
    - ParametersMaps only need to list the flags that are different to the standard parameters
    - Please refer to ModuleConfigPicoFlexxCommon.hpp for examples
- Added an `ENABLE_ALL_LOGS` constant, which has all bits of the RoyaleLoggerLevels bitmask set
- Updated the Unity Test Framework (a C testing framework, unrelated to the similarly-named game engine)
- Added Lewis cameras
- For Master/Slave setups, there is now a UseCaseDefinitionSlave helper class

##### Changes affecting source code customers

- On M2453 devices, performance tuning for 60MHz phases
- On M2453 devices, switched to superframe mode
- Cleaned up some warnings detected by CppCheck
    - Many constructors now use the 'explicit' keyword
    - The `jenkins_cppcheck` script now checks more files
- For OSX and desktop Linux, changed the default for UVC support to use BridgeAmundsen instead of
  LibUVC.  We believe this will now support all existing CX3-based Arctic UVC devices on all USB
  hosts, but for FX3 (non-CX3) based Arctic UVC devices there is a still-open known bug; if
  necessary the change can be reversed by setting `ROYALE_BRIDGE_UVC_IMPLEMENTATION` to `LIBUVC`.

#### Bugfixes

- On some USB hosts, the Amundsen devices' data streaming couldn't be started via `SET_INTERFACE`.
  On these a fallback to `COMMIT_CONTROL` will be used.
- On FX3 (non-CX3) UVC devices, the `SET_INTERFACE` call does not start data streaming; on platforms
  that can use BridgeAmundsen for UVC devices, a `COMMIT_CONTROL` will be sent after the
  `SET_INTERFACE`.
- Fixed a crash if a calibrated device is set to use a frequency that is not in the calibration
- Made the destructor of IGpioAccess virtual
- During CMake's configure step, old versions of royale-version.h will be cleaned up

#### Known Bugs

- On FX3 (non-CX3) UVC devices, BridgeAmundsen is not doing the same disconnection handshake that
  LibUVC does.  Disconnecting and then quickly reconnecting is unreliable on these devices when
  using BridgeAmundsen.

### USB firmware

- Firmware updated to version 0.16.1

#### Features

- Added a second command to start data streaming, for USB hosts where the `SET_INTERFACE` call fails

#### Bugfixes

- All devices identify themselves as bus powered, not self-powered
- When connected at SuperSpeed, all devices declare a max power consumption of 896mA
- Add LPM U1/U2 exit latencies to the SuperSpeed descriptor
- The Amundsen Animator now has the same features enabled as the UVC Animator

#### Known Bugs

- The FX3 codebase has different edge cases to the CX3 codebase.

### Royale Viewer

#### Features

- Improved font sizes when used with 4K display resolution

#### Bugfixes

- When playing a recording, you can now fast forward or rewind by moving the track slider
- Filtering is now supported in 3D mode on Samsung S7 phones

--------------------

### SDK

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed opening of uncalibrated modules
- Fixed build of Python wrapper

v3.12.0 - 2018-01-22
--------------------

### SDK

#### Changes

- Raised minimum supported development platform for Linux to Ubuntu 16.04 and GCC5

#### Features

- Optimized Amundsen's USB buffer handling
- Added the possibility to cache calibration files for modules that use the SPI flash over
  the imager (e.g. Alea)
- Added calculation methods for M2453 exposure values
- Added a new UI to the ROS example
- Added information about the processing to getCameraInfo
- Added Spectre 3.8
- Spectre Multithreading support is now enabled as default
- Added Salome support
- Added official support for Windows 10 for pico maxx and pico monstar

##### Features for source code customers

- Improved Python examples
- Added support for Salome to the SPIFlashTool
- Added a PCL(Point Cloud Library) example. This is not part of the release package, 
  because of bugs in the PCL CMake build system.

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed calling setExposureTime before starting the capturing
- Fixed getMaxSensorHeight for playbacks
- Fixed a bug where the exposure times could be delivered in the wrong order
- Added missing processing flag in DotNet wrapper 

v3.11.0 - 2017-11-30
--------------------

### SDK

#### Changes

- Updated Spectre to v3.7

#### Features

- Calling setExposureTime() before startCapture() is now supported
- With L2 access, automatic binning can be enabled (combining multiple pixels to increase accuracy
  from noisy data)

##### Features for source code customers

- Refactoring of the imager interfaces, towards supporting imagers which have their settings defined
  in storage that is accessible to the imager itself, without needing Royale to have the full data.
- Timing is specific to the imager, so tests using simulated hardware can run to the speed of the
  simulation (faster than wall-clock time for unit tests, and slower for simulated silicon)
- For recording a sequence of imager commands, any required timing is now visible.
- Python support for extended data (level 2 access)
- When building on a non-Windows machine with an incompatible version of OpenCV, CMake will detect
  the incompatibility and not build the OpenCV sample
- Superframes are now supported for IRS10x0C and IRS1x15C (only when connected via CSI-2)

##### Changes affecting source code customers

- On Windows, nightly and developer builds now show a modal pop-up for 5 seconds warning that they
  are not guaranteed to be eye-safe
  - The EXCEPT_DIRTY_DEV flag will disable this when run by the same Windows user who built the
    binary (see doc/build_instructions.md)

#### Bugfixes

- Corrected the formatting of the module identifiers in CameraInfo

### USB firmware

#### Known Bugs

- We are still debugging some edge conditions on Windows 10, with some USB ports the camera does not
  connect reliably

### Royale Viewer

#### Features

- Removed v3.7.0's feature of checking whether new versions of the SDK are available

#### Bugfixes

- On Windows, RoyaleViewer can now load .rrf files from paths that can be represented in the local
  codepage. These were already supported on other platforms.
  - For example, files with umlauts in the path name on machines running German locales

v3.10.0 - 2017-11-03
--------------------

### SDK

#### Changes

- Updated documentation about the importance of the x and y coordinates of the depth data.  The x, y
  layout of the pixels is similar to those of a two-dimensional camera, and it is unlikely to be a
  rectilinear projection (this depends on the camera lens).
- Added an undistortion routine for the lens projection to the OpenCV sample

#### Features

- Expanded the ROS demo, including support for setting the use case and exposure mode
- Support command-line arguments to sample_roypy.py
- Support playing a recording in sample_roypy.py, using the --rrf argument

##### Features for source code customers

- Added sanity checks that the each module's image width is sufficient to hold the pseudodata
- Autoexposure can now be used on uncalibrated modules
- Uncalibrated modules' image data now passes through a similar path to calibrated modules (through
  the processing component), this removes some duplicated code
- Added ability to write arbitrary data to calibration storage via the Royale API layer, this
  requires level 3 access
- Added documentation about `ROYALE_TEST_FILE_PATH`, which is used for loading data during unit
  tests, without depending on the directory that the test is run from

##### Changes affecting source code customers

- Tools that use the PlatformResources class previously had their own copy, they now include the
  code from the sample_utils folder
- Added the ModuleConfigFactoryAnimatorBoard and removed the separate ModuleConfigDataCX3Uvc which
  was used for the Animator board.  Please see ModuleConfigFactoryAnimatorBoard.hpp for details.
- Added the Animator's USB identifiers to the udev rules file
- Some of the integration tests require knowledge of camera, for example checking that the API
  methods return the expected set of use case names.  Many of these only tested the pico flexx, and
  have been updated to make it easier to test additional cameras.
- Added details of the pico maxx and pico monstar to several integration tests.

#### Bugfixes

- The IntermediateData, which is only available with level 2 access, was corrupted in previous
  versions of Royale.

### Royale Viewer

#### Features

- Added tool-tips for buttons, showing which hotkey can be used instead
- Improved the submenus

#### Bugfixes

- Changes to min/max filters and parameters now take effect immediately, previously they took effect
  when the next frame was received.  They now work in the two edge cases where no new frames are
  received: when playback is paused, and on the last frame received before disconnecting a camera.

v3.9.0 - 2017-10-13
--------------------

### SDK

#### Features

- Upgraded to Spectre 3.4
- Added IRS1645C/IRS1615C SPI firmware. Modules that support this can now access the 
  SPI flash through the imager 
- sampleRetrieveData will output the frames as ASCII art, supports command line options and
  now supports mixed mode use cases
- Added a top level html to improve the accessibility of the Doxygen documentation
- Added variant handling for different cameras
- Added a ROS example
- Added examples for Level 2 functionality (raw data readout, setting processing parameters)
- Added support for new Amundsen CX3 firmware

- Setting CallbackData before initialization now works for all values
- For IntermediateData the illuminationEnabled vector grew endlessly

### USB firmware

#### Features

- As well as UVC firmware, we now have non-UVC firmware ("Amundsen") which provides the same 
  functionality without using the native UVC stack.

### Royale Viewer

#### Features

- Added automatic rotation feature

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the background color in the streams combo box

v3.8.0 - 2017-08-31
--------------------

### SDK

#### Features

- Upgraded to Spectre 3.3
- Added an OpenNI2 driver (samples/cpp/sampleOpenNI2Driver), allowing Royale and Royale-supported
  cameras to be used and controlled via OpenNI2
- For Matlab users, timeouts can now be adjusted

##### Features for source code customers

- Some of the integration tests from test_royale (which requires a camera to be attached) have been
  added to the new test_royale_without_hardware, and to the tests run by `make test`
- Added support to identify variants of devices by their calibration data, and for Royale to load
  different configurations based on these identifiers (ModuleConfigFactoryByStorageId)
  - In this release, none of the reference devices are using this feature

##### Changes affecting source code customers

- ModuleConfigs using the multiple-argument constructor of FlashMemoryConfig must change to using
  the Named Parameter Idiom methods (setImageSize, setPageSize and setSectorSize)

#### Bugfixes

- With L2 access, new calibration data can be applied to an already-open device, but in mixed-mode
  use cases this only affected the first stream
- Fixed the playback of some older rrf files which didn't work in Royale 3.7  

### Royale Viewer

- The Android app now has the same version number as the Royale release

#### Features

- With Level 2 access, RoyaleViewer can show a count of the valid pixels

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug in the standard deviation display, after clicking on a second point the value
  displayed was zero

v3.7.0 - 2017-08-10
--------------------

### SDK

#### Changes

- Android builds no longer include libuvc, although UVC devices are still supported.
- In the v3.6.0 release, libuvc was unused on Android.  Android applications'
  `System.loadLibrary("uvc")` call can be removed when building with v3.6.0, and must be removed
  when building with v3.7.0.

#### Features

- Upgraded to Spectre 3.2
- Added read-only support for calibration header format v7

##### Features for source code customers

- Reduced the amount of logging in debug builds when looking for USB devices.  The verbose logs of
  v3.6.0 can be re-enabled by setting the ROYALE_LOGGING_VERBOSE_BRIDGE CMake flag.
- Skylla flash tool can access SPI devices connected directly to the imager.
- The imager component has been refactored, as preparation for using it as a stand-alone tool.

#### Known Bugs

- On some Android devices, any use case faster than 5FPS may stop receiving frames.  In
  RoyaleViewer, touching the screen starts the frames being received again, although the frame drops
  are happening in the I/O layer (the frame-drop stats report them as bridge drops).
- This issue is also seen with previous versions of Royale.

### Royale Viewer

#### Features

- The command-line parameters are now documented in RoyaleViewer.pdf
- The RoyaleViewer will now check whether new versions of the SDK are available.

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed a crash on exit on Android

v3.6.0 - 2017-07-17
--------------------

### SDK

#### Features

- pico maxx and pico monstar have mixed-modes available
- Added a new .NET sample, introducing how to read the camera info
- The installer will now warn before installing 64-bit Royale on 32-bit Windows

##### Features for source code customers

- The CameraCoreBuilderMira has been refactored, to enable modules' storage
  devices to be read during module recognition
- Added a README_tools.md, describing the utilities in the tools/ directory
- A new BridgeAmundsen has been added, which uses LibUsb without needing LibUvc.
  For Android this replaces BridgeUvc, on other non-Windows platforms either
  bridge can be used with UVC devices
- The Imager component is being decoupled from the rest of Royale

#### Bugfixes

- Debug logging on Android is now working again
- Fixed Android support for UVC devices.  Please note that most phones will not
  be able to use the pico maxx or pico monstar, as they require USB 3's
  SuperSpeed bandwidth.

### Royale Viewer

#### Features

- The displayed data can be filtered by min/max distance
- Recorded .rrf files can now be drag-and-dropped
- RoyaleViewer can now be started by clicking on .rrf files in Windows' File Explorer

  equivalent to using v3.1.0's `--rrf <filename>` option.

v3.5.0 - 2017-06-23
--------------------

### SDK

#### Changes

- getAccessLevel will now return the level 1 based instead of 0 based
  (e.g. CameraAccessLevel::L2 returns 2 instead of 1)
- Royale now supports synching cameras and running them as master or slave (if the camera
  supports it, please refer to the documentation of the camera in question)

#### Features

- Added Spectre 3.0

  into the USB device discovery
- Added an OpenCV example (You have to set the OpenCV_DIR to your OpenCV 2 folder
  to enable the compilation)
- Added an example which shows how to export PLY files from a Royale recording
- Added the phase angle and the illumination status to the raw data struct (Level 2 access needed)
- Added support for low FPS use cases 

##### Features for source code customers

- The source code formatting is now using AStyle 3.0

#### Bugfixes

- Added a mechanism to recover after an unsuccessful use case switch
- Fixed a crash that happened when processing parameters were set during raw data readout

### USB firmware

#### Features

- Added firmware image for Daedalus

### Royale Viewer

#### Features

- The color scale for the overlay mode has been optimized so that near objects
  appear brighter than in previous versions

#### Bugfixes

- The color range isn't adapted anymore when changing between 2D and 3D
- The automatic color range adaption now eliminates outliers to give the best
  color map 

v3.3.0 - 2017-05-09
--------------------

### SDK

#### Changes

- Most devices now use the All-In-One imager firmware
- The minimum exposure times for PicoFlexx devices has been increased, because
  of the new firmware
- All FPGA based pmd cameras (for example the MiniCam) are no longer supported
- The license text was clarified with respect to third-party code
- The license text was clarified with respect to third-party imager hardware
- The depth data confidence can now have values between the min and max, 
  previously it could only be either the minimum (0, bad) or 
  the maximum (255, good)
- Added getErrorString to royale.hpp which translates a CameraStatus to a human
  readable description
  
#### Features

- On the pico flexx, two mixed modes have been verified as eye-safe and are now
  available in all access levels
  (Only one of these modes is available when connected via USB2, as the one
  with higher FPS needs USB3's SuperSpeed transfer rate. Please keep in mind that
  many smartphones only provide a USB2 port!)
- A new API function has been added to allow searching for the mixed-mode use
  cases without needing to call setUseCase for each one
- Added Spectre 2.10.0
    - The stray light removal feature is now supported on pico flexx
- Added a new overload of royale::getVersion() which provides the SCM (Git)
  revision number that Royale was built from
- If the application registers an exposure listener and calls setUseCase, the
  listener will now be notified if changing to the new use case causes a change
  in the exposure time
- Minor performance improvement to the effect of debugging logging in non-debug
  builds, where the logging is disabled

- Royale API:
    - Added ICameraDevice::getNumberOfStreams to the C++ API
    - Added the corresponding functions to the C, .NET and Matlab APIs

- royaleCAPI:
    - Added royale_camera_device_get_number_of_streams (API version v330)
    - The C API version is selectable by setting ROYALE_C_API_VERSION
        - "330" is the latest API which adds the new function alias
        - Except for added functions, "330" and "320" are the same as "300"
        - By default, the latest API is used

##### Features for source code customers

- When level 3 access is enabled, setExposureTime no longer enforces the eye
  safety limits
- The build will now handle Royale being a subproject instead of expecting to be
  in the top CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
- The hardware abstraction has been improved, using II2cDeviceAccess instead of
  SensorRole.  The existing II2cAccess class has been renamed II2cBusAccess.
- The BridgeUvc's buffer handling has been separated to BridgeCopyAndNormalize,
  for other bridges to use

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed a race condition in the imager firmware when receiving I2C
  messages at the same time as reconfiguring for exposure changes
- When autoexposure mode is enabled, calling setExposureTime() from an
  application will now return an error status
- Errors during stopCapture() are now reported
- While playing back recorded files and using the L2-only raw data listener,
  the exposure times could be reported in the wrong order
- Performance improvement for changing use case or closing the camera, if the
  temperature sensor is scheduled to be read during that operation

### USB firmware

#### Features

- Updated the prebuilt CX3 firmware image to v0.13.6

#### Known Bugs

- The FX3 Arctic firmware does not support enabling low-power mode for the
  imager.  CX3 devices and Enclustra FX3 devices are not affected.  This
  low-power mode is a new feature, it has been postponed until Royale v3.4.0,
  and we will ensure that it is not enabled for devices with the current FX3
  firmware.  The bug causes corruption in the first image after reverting to
  normal mode.

### Royale Viewer

#### Features

- Mixed modes are now available on the pico flexx, without needing a special
  access level
- The "Log" button will be highlighted if there are new log messages
- Added more command line options to the Viewer
    - --ac Automatically connect to the camera on startup
    - --mode=USE_CASE Select the given use case when connected
    - --ae Enable auto exposure in every mode by default
    - --help List the supported options
- The streamIds (for mixed mode) can now be displayed in the UI
- In the 3D display mode when viewing a mixed-mode use case, the "lock view"
  option will display all streams from the same viewpoint
- The "Force Color" button is now a top level button, instead of only being
  in the Color Range menu
- On Android, the L2/L3/L4 access can now be enabled by passing the access
  code in the Intent that launches RoyaleViewer
- If recording fails then an error message will be added to the log

#### Bugfixes

- Checked for error statuses when changing the exposure
- On Android, the back button is now working correctly

v3.2.0 - 2017-03-16
--------------------

### SDK

#### Features

- Added support for new devices: pico monstar and pico maxx
- Added support for Android 7
- Added functions to shift and retrieve the lens center (only for raw data
  acquisition and Level >= 3)
- Added Git version information into the Royale version
- Added Spectre 2.9.1
- Setting calibration data before calling initialize will force Royale to use
  this calibration data
- Royale CAPI default version is now 320 (due to the new functions for the Git
  version and lens center)  

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed a crash changing processing parameters during recording
- royale::Vector's constructor is now explicit, which avoids unexpected conversions to Vector
- ICameraDevice::stopCapture will now report errors, if they occur
- Fixed a bug that the SparsePointCloud vector wasn't cleared between callbacks

### USB firmware

#### Features

- Updated the prebuilt CX3 firmware image to v0.13.4
- The firmware version can now be read via getBridgeInfo()

#### Bugfixes

- UVC devices no longer include a Colorformat in their descriptor,
  which was incorrect for our infrared camera
- LibUVC will no longer print a "unsupported descriptor subtype: 13"
  message, which was caused by the Colorformat.

### Royale Viewer

- Mixed mode support
  - Multiview
  - Updated exposure dialog for multiple streams
- Using lens parameters for the 3D view
- Added command line options to the Viewer
    - --rrf=somefile.rrf will open up the specified file and start playback
    - --cal=somecal.cal will use the specified calibration file for calculations

#### Features

- Added support for HighDPI (Retina) on Mac OSX

v3.1.0 - 2017-01-27
--------------------

### SDK

#### Changes

- Removed deprecated functions (these were deprecated in v2.2.0, they threw exceptions 
  instead of returning a CameraStatus)
  
#### Features

- Added Spectre 2.8.5
- Precompiled versions of the examples can now be found in the bin folder
- Reworked parts of the Matlab wrapper which leads to faster readout of rrf files
- Added libraries for 64-bit Android ARM
- On Windows with UVC devices, Royale used to keep ownership of the system image 
  buffers while processing data. It now copies the data to Royale-allocated buffers, 
  ensuring that enough buffers are allocated to capture the incoming data
- On Linux, the libraries' DT_RUNPATH now includes $ORIGIN, this means that ld
  searches in the same directory for libraries that other libraries depend on.
  (Please see v3.0.0's Known Bugs section for an explanation of what this fixes.)

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the Matlab wrapper which was not working properly in 3.0
- Fixed multiple memory leaks in Royale::Vector
- Fixed SSC feature for All-in-one firmware

### Royale Viewer

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug on Android devices which cause some menu items to not reappear after 
  stopping and restarting the sensor
- Changed size of color range menu to fix the display on small devices

v3.0.0 - 2016-12-16
--------------------

### SDK

#### Features

- Added mixed mode capabilities to the Royale framework
    - There are currently no mixed mode use cases available for the pico flexx
    - Use cases can now contain multiple streams
    - The id of the current stream is transferred in the data callbacks

- Royale C++ API:
    - Many ICameraDevice methods now take an optional StreamId.  These will work
      as before with use cases that have only one stream, but will return an
      error if the StreamId is not provided when there are multiple streams.
    - New functions : 
        - Level 1 : royale::CameraStatus getStreams (royale::Vector<royale::StreamId> &streams)
        - Level 2 : royale::CameraStatus getExposureGroups (royale::Vector< royale::String > &exposureGroups)
        - Level 2 : royale::CameraStatus setExposureTime (const String &exposureGroup, uint32_t exposureTime)
        - Level 2 : royale::CameraStatus getExposureLimits (const String &exposureGroup, royale::Pair<uint32_t, uint32_t> &exposureLimits)
        - Level 2 : royale::CameraStatus setExposureForGroups (const royale::Vector<uint32_t> &exposureTimes)
    - Adapted functions : 
        - Level 1 : royale::CameraStatus setExposureTime (uint32_t exposureTime, royale::StreamId streamId = 0)
        - Level 1 : royale::CameraStatus setExposureMode (royale::ExposureMode exposureMode, royale::StreamId streamId = 0)
        - Level 1 : royale::CameraStatus getExposureMode (royale::ExposureMode &exposureMode, royale::StreamId streamId = 0)
        - Level 1 : royale::CameraStatus getExposureLimits (royale::Pair<uint32_t, uint32_t> &exposureLimits, royale::StreamId streamId = 0)
        - Level 2 : royale::CameraStatus setExposureTimes (const royale::Vector<uint32_t> &exposureTimes, royale::StreamId streamId = 0)
        - Level 2 : royale::CameraStatus setProcessingParameters (const royale::ProcessingParameterVector &parameters, uint16_t streamId = 0)
        - Level 2 : royale::CameraStatus getProcessingParameters (royale::ProcessingParameterVector &parameters, uint16_t streamId = 0)
    
- royaleCAPI:
    - The C API version is selectable by setting ROYALE_C_API_VERSION to either
        - "300" for the new API which includes stream ids, or
        - "220" to use an API compatible with the long-term support branch.
        - By default, the latest API is used.
    - The documentation for this is in the new CAPIVersion.h, which is
      automatically included from the CAPI headers that need it. 
    - The C API functions that take a stream id take it as their second
      argument, after the camera handle.  This is different to the C++ API,
      because in C++ it has to be last to make it optional. When using a use
      case with only one stream, zero can be passed as the stream id argument.

    - For migration, the latest API version is also made available using
      alternative names (with a "_new_api" suffix added) if the preprocessor
      symbol ROYALE_C_API_MIGRATION is defined.
    - v2.2.0 had a similar mechanism with the ROYALE_NEW_API_2_2_0 and
      ROYALE_FINAL_API_2_2_0 definitons, but defaulted to the old v2.1.0 API.
    - The v2.1.0 API is no longer supported,

- RoyaleDotNet API:
    - As with the C++ API, functions now take an optional StreamId.  When using
      a use case with multiple streams, adding the StreamId is mandatory.

- Added Spectre 2.7.5.64
- Added possibility to read out temperatures from the pseudo data of 
  the imager
- Added possibility to define levels for use cases
- Separated RRFReader/RRFWriter from Royale Core
- Added new RRF version 3 which can handle mixed mode use cases
- Added calculation of the registers used for the SSC feature (previously
  only certain cases were supported)
- Increased the accuracy of the framerate calculation

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed a race condition in the Android example
- CMake now not only searches for the MATLAB MCR, but also for MATLAB itself

- royaleCAPI:
    - In v2.2.0, royale_camera_device_set_exposure_mode used the v2.1.0 version
      even when ROYALE_FINAL_API_2_2_0 was set, the v2.2.0 version was only
      used when the "2" suffix was used.  In v3.0.0's 220 compatibility mode,
      this function's name still has the "2" suffix.
  
#### Known Bugs

On some Linux systems, including Debian's next release "Stretch", the
indirectly-linked shared libraries are not found.  For CAPI applications, this
causes a failure to load libroyale.so.3.0.0, for C++ applications the failure is
on loading libuvc.  We believe this was triggered by a toolchain change setting
DT_RUNPATH instead of DT_RPATH, it also affects the 2.3.0 SDK when building on
an up-to-date Debian Stretch system.

A workaround for this issue is to copy all the libraries from the SDK's bin
directory (and subdirectories), and use a renamed copy of the
bin/royaleviewer.sh wrapper script to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

  instead of a detailed DeviceDetectedError.

v2.2.0 - 2016-09-30
--------------------

### SDK

#### Changes

- Royale C++ API:
  All ICameraDevice methods are now returning a CameraStatus. The following functions were added 
  and their previous versions were marked as deprecated :
  
    getAccessLevel
    getCameraInfo
    getCameraName
    getCurrentUseCase
    getExposureLimits
    getExposureMode
    getFrameRate
    getId
    getMaxFrameRate
    getMaxSensorHeight
    getMaxSensorWidth
    getUseCases
    isCalibrated
    isCapturing

- royaleCAPI:
  To adapt to the changes in the Royale C++ API, additional calls were added to the CAPI:

    royale_camera_device_get_access_level2
    royale_camera_device_get_camera_info2
    royale_camera_device_get_camera_name2
    royale_camera_device_get_current_use_case2
    royale_camera_device_get_exposure_limits2
    royale_camera_device_get_exposure_mode2
    royale_camera_device_get_frame_rate2
    royale_camera_device_get_id2
    royale_camera_device_get_max_frame_rate2
    royale_camera_device_get_max_sensor_height2
    royale_camera_device_get_max_sensor_width2
    royale_camera_device_get_use_cases2
    royale_camera_device_is_calibrated2
    royale_camera_device_is_capturing2
    royale_camera_device_is_connected2

  Please note that these names with a trailing "2" are only temporary. In a future release the deprecated 
  royaleCAPI v2.1.0 calls will be removed, and the old names will refer to the "2" version of the functions. 
  In a release after that, the "2" names will be removed.
  If you want to use the final naming already, you can utilize the defines ROYALE_NEW_API_2_2_0 and 
  ROYALE_FINAL_API_2_2_0. Refer to sampleCAPI for further information and usage examples.
  
#### Features

- Added read support for Polar header version 6
- The UVC C2 camera now supports the same use cases as the PicoFlexx
