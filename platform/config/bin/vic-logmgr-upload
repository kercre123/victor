# Victor log manager upload
#
# This script collects a snapshot of recent log data into a compressed
# (gzip) file, then uploads the file to an Anki Blobstore bucket.
#
# If upload fails, exit with an appropriate error. There is no attempt
# at retry or deferred send.
#
# The default filter specification will capture all messages from Anki service processes.
# It will also capture system messages reported at ERROR or FATAL level, including tombstone traces
# reported by debuggerd.
#
# Default configuration values may be overridden by environment.
